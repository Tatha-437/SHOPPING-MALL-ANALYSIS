# WORLD-SUICIDE-ANALYSIS

It seems that with each passing year, suicides are becoming more common. Myself, who is only 20 years old, I have an acquaintance who during college committed suicide. During the week, I was hanging out by Kaggle, and found a set of data on suicides. At the time I thought about doing a little analysis and try to understand the subject better. So now, in this article, I present this brief review.




Data description

Each data in the data set represents a year, a country, a certain age range, and a gender. For example, in the country Brazil in the year 1985, over 75 years, committed suicide 129 men.

The data set has 10 attributes. These being:

Country: country of record data;
Year: year of record data;
Sex: Sex (male or female);
